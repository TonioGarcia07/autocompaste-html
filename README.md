This repository is a HCI experiment which aims at determining which technique is more accurate and efficient for copy-pasting (the usual one or a new one: autocompaste).

Please visit the page https://toniogarcia07.github.io/autocompaste-html/ if you want to launch the experiment. If you don't have an ID, you can still lauch the experiment, but the result won't be taken into account.
Ask me an ID if you want me to consider you results.
